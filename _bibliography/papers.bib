title={Characterizing High Rate GNSS Velocity Noise for Synthesizing a GNSS Strong Motion Learning Catalog}, volume={2},

DOI={10.26443/seismica.v2i2.978}, 
abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Data-driven approaches to identify geophysical signals have proven beneficial in high dimensional environments where model-driven methods fall short. GNSS offers a source of unsaturated ground motion observations that are the data currency of ground motion forecasting and rapid seismic hazard assessment and alerting. However, these GNSS-sourced signals are superposed onto hardware-, location- and time-dependent noise signatures influenced by the Earth’s atmosphere, low-cost or spaceborne oscillators, and complex radio frequency environments. Eschewing heuristic or physics based models for a data-driven approach in this context is a step forward in autonomous signal discrimination. However, the performance of a data-driven approach depends upon substantial representative samples with accurate classifications, and more complex algorithm architectures for deeper scientific insights compound this need. The existing catalogs of high-rate (&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;ILfuVd&amp;quot; lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;hgKElc&amp;quot;&amp;gt;≥&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;1Hz) GNSS ground motions are relatively limited. In this work, we model and evaluate the probabilistic noise of GNSS velocity measurements over a hemispheric network. We generate stochastic noise time series to augment transferred low-noise strong motion signals from within 70 kilometers of strong events (&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;ILfuVd&amp;quot; lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;hgKElc&amp;quot;&amp;gt;≥&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; M&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;W&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; 5.0) from an existing inertial catalog. We leverage known signal and noise information to assess feature extraction strategies and quantify augmentation benefits. We find a classifier model trained on this expanded pseudo-synthetic catalog improves generalization compared to a model trained solely on a real-GNSS velocity catalog, and offers a framework for future enhanced data driven approaches.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
