I'm a data scientist at EarthScope Consortium and research affiliate at the Satellite Navigation and Sensing Laboratory at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

I'm excited to talk about geophysics, data science, satellite remote sensing, research cloud computing and open-science.  I made this personal website to share projects and experiment with science communication.  If you found yourself reading this far and are interested in some of these topics, send me a message.
