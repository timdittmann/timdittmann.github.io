I am a data scientist at EarthScope Consortium and research affiliate at the Satellite Navigation and Sensing Laboratory at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

I am passionate about high-impact research at the intersection of geophysics and data science.   
I advocate for open-science and novel uses of cloud-based computing for transformative science.  If you found yourself reading this far, Iâ€™d love to hear what you are working on.
