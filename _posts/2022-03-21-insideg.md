InsideGNSS published our article <a href="https://insidegnss.com/expanding-the-role-of-gnss-in-seismic-modeling/">"Expanding the Role of GNSS in Seismic Monitoring"</a>.

I enjoyed taking our previous manuscripts, written with seismology/solid earth geophysics audience, and adapting them to the InsideGNSS audience, a technical industry magazine focused on GPS/GNSS engineering.
