I attended my first <a href="https://www.ion.org/">Institute of Naviation</a> conference: the <a href="https://www.ion.org/">2024 International Technical Meeting</a> in Long Beach, California.  The highlights for me were co-chairing a session with Cecile Deprez at DLR: Precise GNSS Positioning and Applications and some excellent conversations with new and old friends.  The giant lego Queen Mary aboard the real Queen Mary was also a highlight!

Colleagues and I also presented two papers in the <a href="https://www.ion.org/itm/sessions.cfm?sessionID=1660#">Atmospheric Effects, GNSS Remote Sensing and Scientific Applications session</a> .
