I am currently project lead for [an initiative](https://www.earthscope.org/data/cloud/) to seed adoption of cloud computing for geophysical research at scale.  This checks two exciting boxes for me:
* **scientific compute equity:** This initative will reduce barriers for a broader audience to do exploratory geophysical analysis. Everyone with a web browser and internet 'touch' data and explore science.
* **scientific discoveries from "big data":** This iniative will allow researchers and citizen scientistists to adopt big data strategies from tech and other compute heavy scientific fields to advance our geophysical understanding. **Recipe: open source software + serverless compute + adjacent, high throughput open data stores** .

## Our geophysical cloud research stack:
*Presented at [SSA2024](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article-abstract/95/2B/1113/638296/SSA-2024-Annual-Meeting?redirectedFrom=fulltext)*
* [Analysis ready, cloud optimized](https://tiledb.com/) geophysical data containers in AWS S3
* Autoscaling jupyterlab in AWS in partnership with [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/)
